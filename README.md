// Tower-of-Hanoi-stack-using-array
//Here I have used stack with the help of array.
Int data type is used insted of long double so there is limitation in input of number of disk.
Maximum 30 disk is the limit in order to get correct output in this program.
Algorithm:

1] START
2] ENTER NUMBER OF DISKS.
3] PUSH DISKS IN TOWER 1.
4] FIND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS TO MOVE DISKS FROM TOWER 1 TO TOWER 3.   {X=(2^N)-1}
5] THEN DISPLAY ALL TOWERS AS AN  OUTPUT.
6] FOR i LESS THAN TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS.   {for(i=1;i<=x;i++)}
7] CHECK IF(i%3==1) TAKE VALUE A=POPED ELEMENT OF TOWER 1,B=POPED ELEMENT OF TOWER 3.
7(A)] CHECK AGAIN IF(A==0) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 1 WITH VALUE B.
7(B)] CHECK AGAIN IF(B==0) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 3 WITH VALUE A.
7(C)] CHECK AGAIN IF(A>B) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 1 WITH VALUE A AND B.
7(C)] ELSE PUSH IN TOWER 3 WITH VALUE B AND A.
8] THEN AFTER EACH CASE DISPLAY ALL TOWERS AS AN OUTPUT.
9] CHECK IF(i%3==2) TAKE VALUE A=POPED ELEMENT OF TOWER 1,B=POPED ELEMENT OF TOWER 2.
9(A)] CHECK AGAIN IF(A==0) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 1 WITH VALUE B.
9(B)] CHECK AGAIN IF(B==0) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 2 WITH VALUE A.
9(C)] CHECK AGAIN IF(A>B) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 1 WITH VALUE A AND B.
9(C)] ELSE PUSH IN TOWER 2 WITH VALUE B AND A.
10] THEN AFTER EACH CASE DISPLAY ALL TOWERS AS AN OUTPUT.
11] CHECK IF(i%3==0) TAKE VALUE A=POPED ELEMENT OF TOWER 2,B=POPED ELEMENT OF TOWER 3
11(A)] CHECK AGAIN IF(A==0) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 2 WITH VALUE B.
11(B)] CHECK AGAIN IF(B==0) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 3 WITH VALUE A.
11(C)] CHECK AGAIN IF(A>B) THEN PUSH IN TOWER 2 WITH VALUE A AND B.
11(C)] ELSE PUSH IN TOWER 3 WITH VALUE B AND A.
12] THEN AFTER EACH CASE DISPLAY ALL TOWERS AS AN OUTPUT.
13] FINALLY AFTER THAT DISPLAY THE FINAL RESULT WITH TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS.
14] STOP.
